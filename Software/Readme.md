# DC801 Badge Software

We hope you enjoyed the badge this year.  We're very excited this year to have worked with our friend in #badgelife to develop a cross-badge communications platform.

The badge this year had these software features:

* Ability to set a username, which was also broadcast via bluetooth
* Infection game over bluetooth with other badges
* Shout outs to other badge types
* Full suite of tests on-board
